    This string is composed of team players. Determine if the game is balanced. A game is balanced if there are equal amount of players.
    If the game is balanced -> return the string 'game is balanced!'
    If the game is unbalanced -> return a string 'game is unbalanced! Team ${team that has more} is more likely to win!'

    Input: 'xxooxo' Output: 'game is balanced!'
    Input: 'xxxxoxo' Output: 'game is unbalanced! Team x is more likely to win!'
    Input: 'xXxoOo' Output: 'game is balanced!'

    Hint: 
    1. Use a loop. To access a character in a string: 
    //            0123
    const name = 'abcd' // access by index
    name[2] // 'c'
    2. you might want to use .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase()
