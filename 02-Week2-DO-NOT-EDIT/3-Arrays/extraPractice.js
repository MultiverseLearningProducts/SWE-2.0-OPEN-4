//Exercises to practice array methods:
push() method:
Write a function `addToInventory` that takes in an array of strings representing the current inventory items and a new item, and returns the updated inventory with the new item added to the end of the array using the `push()` method.

pop() method:
Write a function `removeLastItem` that takes in an array of strings and removes the last item from the array using the `pop()` method. The function should return the updated array.

unshift() method:
Write a function `addToStart` that takes in an array of strings and a new string, and returns the updated array with the new string added to the beginning of the array using the `unshift()` method.

shift() method:
Write a function `removeFirstItem` that takes in an array of strings and removes the first item from the array using the `shift()` method. The function should return the updated array.

reverse() method:
Write a function `reverseOrder` that takes in an array of strings and returns the array with the order of the elements reversed using the `reverse()` method.

concat() method:
Write a function `combineArrays` that takes in two arrays of strings and returns a new array that is the combination of both arrays using the `concat()` method.

join() method:
Write a function `arrayToString` that takes in an array of strings and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the elements in the array separated by a comma, using the `join()` method.

splice() method:
Write a function `removeAndInsert` that takes in an array of numbers, a starting index, and two more numbers. The function should remove `n` number of elements from the array starting at the given index using the `splice()` method, and then insert the two additional numbers into the array at the same starting index. The function should return the updated array.

slice() method:
Write a function `copyArray` that takes in an array of numbers and a starting index and ending index. The function should return a new array that is a copy of a portion of the original array, starting from the starting index and ending at the ending index (not including the element at the ending index), using the `slice()` method.

map() method:
Write a function `doubleNumbers` that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array with each number doubled using the `map()` method.

forEach() method:
Write a function `printValues` that takes in an array of numbers and prints out each number in the array using the `forEach()` method.
