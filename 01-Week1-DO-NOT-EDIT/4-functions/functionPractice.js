1. Write a function called isPositive that takes in a number as a parameter and returns true if the number is positive, and false if the number is negative or zero.

2. Write a function called isEven that takes in a number as a parameter and returns true if the number is even, and false if the number is odd.

3. Write a function called isVowel that takes in a letter as a parameter and returns true if the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) and false if the letter is a consonant.

4. Write a function called getGrade that takes in a number as a parameter (representing a student's score) and returns the letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the following scale:

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59

5. Write a function called isLeapYear that takes in a year as a parameter and returns true if the year is a leap year and false if the year is not a leap year. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400.
