JWT - Jason Web token

Header - Contains metadata and information on how the token is encrypted and signed

Payload - Is where the actual data is stored and it is encoded as a JSON object.

Signature - Is a value that is generated by combining the encoded header and payload with a secret key using a specified algorithm. The signature is what ensures the authenticity and integrity of the JWT.
