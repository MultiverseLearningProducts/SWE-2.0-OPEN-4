- Learn how to write a function and understand its syntax []

    1. What is a function?
        - a function is a block of code that can be reused multiple times.
        - function functionName(parameter) {
            //your function definition
        }
        - parameters represent the information that you eventually want to use inside of your function
        - to run a function, you simply write the name of the function with parenthesis. If the function requires parameters, you 'pass' in an argument into the parenthesis.
    2. What is a return statement?
        - return allows us to get the result from our function
    3. How do you write a function? Are there other ways?
        -Arrow function notation
    4. How do you use a function?
        - you can use a function by invoking it by writing the name of the function and a parenthesis next to the name.
        nameOfFunction(arugument1, argument2, etc)
