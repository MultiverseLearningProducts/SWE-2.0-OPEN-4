Lesson Objectives:

1. Learn about type coercion [x]
2. Learn about Truthiness and Falsiness [x]
3. Learn about Scopes []

--------------------------------------------------------
type coercion [x]
  1. What is type coercion? Provide an example of implicit and explicit type coercion.
    - type coercion - when a value is changed from one data type to another

  2. Review: What is the difference between double equals (==) and triple equals (===)?
    - triple examines type and value
    - double only examines value, you can evaluate something like '20' == 20 to true
--------------------------------------------------------
truthiness and falsiness [x]
  1. What happens when a value is coerced to a boolean?
    - value will be considered truthy or falsey and then coerced to that true or false value
  2. What values are considered truthy?
    - most strings, arrays, numbers, objects
  3. What values are considered falsey?
    - 0, '', '-0', 'null', 'undefined', 'NaN'
  4. How can we use '!' to coerce a value to a boolean that reflects its truthiness?
    - we can use '!' to implicitly coerce a value to its opposite boolean value, i.e. from true to false OR from false to true
    - we can use '!!' to implicitly and cleanly coerce a value to its boolean value

--------------------------------------------------------
scopes []
  1. What does scope mean outside of programming? What would this mean in a programming context?
    - scope refers to where a variable is accessible at a specific location in your code
  2. What is functional scope? How do we define a variable in functional scope?
    - functional scope is when a variable can be read only inside the function
    - define the variable using the 'let' keyword
  3. What is block scope? How do we define a variable in block scope?
    - block scope is when a variable can be read only inside a block 
    - define the variable using 'let' or 'const'
    - 'var' keyword does not understand block scope, for example a variable defined with var can be read outside of a block if defined in a function
  4. What is global scope? How do we define a variable in global scope?
    - global scope is when a variable can be read anywhere within your file
    - define using 'let', 'const', 'var' outside of a function or block

- note: vscode (and other editors) will gray out variables that aren't being read - can be a clue to see what scope it's being defined in and if that scope needs to be changed
