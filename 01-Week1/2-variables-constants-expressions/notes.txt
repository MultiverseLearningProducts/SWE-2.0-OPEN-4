Introduction:

Data primitives [x]
    What are the 6 primitive data types in Javascript?
        1. Numbers 
        2. Strings - Are a sequence of characters. They are used to represent text and are enclosed in quotation marks (double or single is ok).
        3. Boolean - Represents true or false values. They are often used in conditions and control flow.
        4. Undefined - A variable that is declared but not assigned a value. It's assigned the value of 'undefined'
        5. Symbol - New data primitive (ES6) - it is a unique and immutable value that is intended to be used as identifiers for object properties.
        6. Null - represents no value or no object.

Variables vs Constants [ ]

    What is a variable?
        - A container that holds a value.

    What is the main difference between variables and constants in JavaScript?
        - A variable is a container that holds a value that you can reassign.
        - A constant is a container that holds a value that you cannot reassign (change).

    When would you use a variable and when would you use a constant?
        - Use a variable when you expect the value to change (score in a game, users age, birthday)
        - Use a constant when you expect the value to stay static (importing modules, port number)


let and const [ ]

    What is the difference between 'let' and 'const'?
        - 'let' - helps us create a variable that we can reassign.
        - 'const' - helps us create a variable that we cannot reassign.

    How do we declare a variable using the keyword 'let' and 'const'?
        - use the keyword 'let' followed by a name of the variable -> equal sign -> data
        - use the 'const' keyword followed by a name for the variable, followed by the data

    What is the difference between using let and const when declaring a variable?
        - let creates a variable that you can change
        - const creates a variable that you cannot change

    How do we reassign a variable?
        - you can only reassign let variables.
        - To reassign, simple just write the name of the let variable followed by = and the new value
