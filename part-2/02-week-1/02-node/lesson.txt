------------------------------------------------------------
- What is Node?
    - Node is software used for building applications and web services. 
    - Node allows developers to use JS to create software that can run on servers and interact with webpages.
    - An analogy could be to think of Node as a fishtank
        - water as the enviorment
        - the materials that allow the fishtank to thrive as the 'dependencies'

------------------------------------------------------------
- How to create a Node project?
    1. check to see if you have node installed: node --version
    2. Navigate to the desired location of where you want your project to exist.
    3. Create a new directory -> cd into the directory
    4. npm init -> will prompt you with the package.json configuration requests

------------------------------------------------------------
- How to install dependencies and use them?

    1. The package.json file is a file that lists various information about the project and its dependencies.
    2. To install dependencies npm install nameOfDependency
        - 1. Make sure you are in the correct directory
        - 2. npm install nameOfDependency
        - 3. If you encounter this bug:
            SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
            1. Go into package.json -> add "type": "module"

------------------------------------------------------------
- How to export files and use them in different files?

    1. In the file that you want to export,
        a. If only one item, use: 
            export default nameOfFunction
        b. If more than one item use:
            export {
                function1,
                function2,
                ...
            }
    
        In the file that you want to import and use the functions:
            import { function1, item1, etc } from '/pathToFile.extension'

------------------------------------------------------------
1. create a node project
2. download the colors depenency
3. create a file with a few functions
    - learn how to use this new depency that you downloaded
4. create another file and practice exporting, importing files.
    - practice using functions that live in different locations.
