TDD?
- Test Driven Development
    - to take TDD approach, you emphasize writing tests for your code before the actual code.
    Axl - Teaches you to think in a certain way
        - Think about things that may break 
        - Think about edge cases 
        - Grounds you in logic + reality

    - Taking a TDD approach can help us catch bugs and identify things that could go wrong early in the development cycle before we commit to writing our code.
