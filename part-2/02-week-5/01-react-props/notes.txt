----------------------------------------------------

part 1 - Setting up React with an existing node project

1. npm i react react-dom parcel-bundler
2. create a client folder
3. create our index.html
4. set up an entry point to our app

part 2 - Exploring React concepts

1. What is react?
React is a popular js library used to build user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.

2. How does react work?
React works by rendering components to a virtual representation of the DOM (Document Object Model), compares the difference between the Virtual DOM and the actual DOM and will render the difference.

3. Creating components
- Functional components 
- Class component

4. Parent vs Child
- When we render another React component within a React component, the 'host' component is the parent and the 'rendered' component is the child. 
    - app.js <- parent component
        |
    - Card.js <- child component / parent component
        |
    - SomethingElse.js <- child component

5. Passing props
    - Props are used to pass data from one component to another
