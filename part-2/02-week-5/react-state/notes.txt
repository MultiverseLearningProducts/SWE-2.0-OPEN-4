1. Move all of your existing components aside from your app.js top level component into a folder called components.
    Your folders structure should look like this:
        /client
            /components
                - Card.js
        -index.html
        -index.js
        -styles.css

2. Create a new functional component called Counter.js and store that in your new components folder.
