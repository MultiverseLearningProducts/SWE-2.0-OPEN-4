Warm up exercise:

1. Move all of your existing components aside from your app.js top level component into a folder called components.
    Your folders structure should look like this:
        /client
            /components
                - Card.js
        -index.html
        -index.js
        -styles.css

2. Create a new functional component called Counter.js and store that in your new components folder.

Q: What is state?
- In React, 'state' is used to store and manage data that changes over time within a component.
- State is used to update and render a component dynamically. 
- When the state of a component changes, React will re-render the component with the updated state


- useState - hook <- to store and manager state in our functional components

Q: What is a hook?
- A react function that allows you to use state and other React features in a functional component.

Q: What is the difference between props vs state?
- Props are used to pass data between components, whereas state represents the internal state of a component.
