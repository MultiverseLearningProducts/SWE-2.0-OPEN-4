Lesson Objectives

- Learn what an ORM is [x]
- How to create a sequelize instance 
- How to create a model 
- Learn how to seed data into our database

ORM - Object Relational Mapper - maps object-oriented code to relational database structures.
Sequelize - Allows you to work with SQL databases in an object-oriented way by providing abstractions that represent tables and their relationships as Javascript classes and Objects.
    - It will translate our javascript code into SQL queries under the hood to make it a lot easier for us to interact with the database.




DEMO:

Part 1: Setting up our folder directory

- db/
    - models/
        - User.js
    - seeders/
        - seed-data.json
        - seed-users.js
    - index.js 

Part 2: 

    1. Creating our sequelize instance. -> index.js [x]
    2. Create our sequelize models. -> models/User.js [x]
    3. Understand our seed file -> seeders/seed-data.json [x] - example data
    4. Create a seed function to put our data into our tables. seeders/seed-users.js [x]

    ** create a script to seed our database using an npm run script **

Pair Exercise:

    1. Create another model Pets and define the fields
    2. Create a seed file called seed-data-pets.js
    3. Seed it into the database
    4. Check db browser if the table was created.
