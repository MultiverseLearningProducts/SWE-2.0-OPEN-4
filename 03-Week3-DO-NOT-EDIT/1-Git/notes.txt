Lesson Objectives

1. What is Git?
2. Git vs. Github
3. Clone vs. Fork a repo
4. Basic Git commands
5. Two workflows:
    - A- working from an existing directory
    - B- Creating your own directory

------------------------------------------------
1. What is Git?
    - It's the world's most popular version control.
    - You can keep track of every 'version' of your application using it's history.
        - Some applications of this is if your application breaks and you can't fix the issue, you can 'restore' a previous version of your application as long as you have the 'address' of it (node)
    - You can collaborate on projects with others by creating 'branches'
        - When you're collaborators are done with their portion, they can combine their changes to the current version of the project by 'merging' their changes

------------------------------------------------
2. Git vs. Github
    -Git - version control system that allows you to manager and keep track of changes in your codebase.

    -Git-hub - a web-based platform that provides hosting for your git repositories.
------------------------------------------------
3. Clone vs. Fork a repo
    - Forking a repo - Creating a copy of the repository that is completely independent to the original authored repository. It is unlinked to the original repository

    - Cloning a repo - creating a copy of the repository that is linked to the original repository
------------------------------------------------

A- working from an existing directory

- copy the github link 
- terminal - navigate to the folder where you want to clone your project into
    - pwd - to check your current working directory
    - cd nameOfFolder - change directory

GIT COMMAND:
- git clone url - this will download a copy of the repository to your local machine

- navigate to your project on vs code -> make your changes 

- git status -> to see what files you have modified 
- git add . -> adds all the modifications to be staged
- git commit -m "add a message" -> commiting your changes, and also adding a message to your commit to reference
- git push -> pushing your changes to update the repo on github
